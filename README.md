With Rimmel you can create webapps that are:
1. **Faster** than equivalent webapps built with popular "Virtual DOM" or "Change-Detection" based frameworks (e.g.: React, Vue, Angular)
2. 50-90% **lighter** than equivalent applications written with many other imperative frameworks (e.g.: Angular, React, Vue, SOLID, Svelte)
3. More easily **testable** than equivalent applications written with most other imperative frameworks (e.g.: Angular, React, Vue, SOLID, Svelte, Nue, VanJS)

Really?<br>
Yes, this is why:
1. Rimmel only uses reactive primitives that make direct DOM manipulation, without the need of any tree-traversal logic or similar overhead
2. It's fairly normal for larger Rimmel webapps to be only about 100-200KB of total minzipped JavaScript code
3. Rimmel supports the functional-reactive paradigm which not only makes it easier to test functionality, but it actually needs less testing for the same code quality

<br>

Rimmel is built around the Observable and Observer patterns.<br>
To put it simply, DOM events are Observables, everything else (innerHTML, class names, attributes) is Observers.

```html
<button onclick="${observer1}">click me</button>

<span class="${observable1}"></span>
<div style="color: ${observable2};"></div>
<div>${observable3}</div>
```


No need for JSX, Virtual DOM, Babel, HyperScript, Webpack, React.<br>
No need to "set up" or "tear down" observables in your components, so you can keep them pure.<br>
No need to unsubscribe or dispose of observers or perform any manual memory cleanup.

<br>

Rimmel works with standard JavaScript/TypeScript template literals tagged with `rml` out of the box.
<br>

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World ðŸ‘‹
The modern "Hello World" for reactive interfaces is the click counter: one button, you click it, he counts it.<br>
This is how it works:

<img src="docs/assets/how-rimmel-works.png" alt="How RimmelJS Works">

The `click` event is "sourced" into `counter`, which is an Observable Subject that takes `Event` objects and emits numbers.<br>

The result is then "sinked" into the `<span>` element at the end.

## Imperative-Reactive? No
Most other reactive or non-reactive JavaScript UI libraries and frameworks out there are designed for the imperative programming paradigm. Occasionally they may support a few aspects of functional programming. Third-party adapters can also help with it, but the truth is that FRP was just an afterhthought and its use is severely limited in practice.

Rimmel is different in that it does primarily focus on the functional-reactive paradigm (FRP, for short).
Although some imperative-reactive patterns work, supporting them is not the main purpose of this project.

## Functional-Reactive? Yes
What makes Rimmel functional-reactive is that you can treat everything as an Observable stream, in particular event handlers and data sinks.

This means you never really write code that changes the status of something else, as in:<br />
```
target.property = value;
```

What you do instead, is you _declare_ the stream your changes come from and what better place for that if not your templates?

```
<target property="${source}">
```

## Virtual DOM? No
The concept of Virtual DOM originates from the assumption that the DOM is slow, which might be the case for some frameworks that make large numbers of unnecessary updates or re-renders, in which case it may become less expensive to run those computations outside of the DOM.

Since Rimmel never makes any unnecessary DOM update and the concept of a component re-rendering doesn't exist by itself, the whole idea of a Virtual DOM is simply not needed.

Rimmel uses Sinks, which are memory and/or performance-optimised direct DOM manipulation functions, attached to the Promises or Observable streams you provide. When there is new data, it gets sinked to the DOM immediately. You are in control of when or how often you emit data, so you can also throttle/sample/debounce as you see fit for your needs.

## Component Re-rendering? Never
Several UI libraries and frameworks around have a concept of component re-rendering, which implies running the whole component's function again in order to check its output and diff it against the DOM.
Since Rimmel makes use of reactive streams for state management, everything turned out to be dramatically simpler.

There is only one time a component is "rendered" and that is when it first lands on the page. After that, only "updates" happen, which are performed with native DOM calls.


## Conditional (static) Rendering? Just use Plain-Old JS
If you need to render something based on a condition, plain-old standard JS can help you. No need for further abstractions:

```javascript
document.body.innerHTML = rml`
  <main>
    ${
      condition == true
        ? rml`<div>yes, it's true</div>`
        : rml`<div>no, it's false</div>`
    }
  </main>
```

You only want to use this method if your condition is static, as in non-reactive and the content won't need to reflect your changes over time.
Otherwise read on.


## Conditional (dynamic) Rendering? Just use Observable Streams
If you need to render based on a live, reactive condition (so when the condition changes, the other thing is rendered) you can just use a normal Observable stream:

```javascript
// Use RxJS's `map` operator to emit any HTML based on whatever conditions you like
const conditionalStream = new Subject().pipe(
  map(data => {
    if(data.hasSomething) {
      return rml`<child1>`
    } else {
      return rml`<child2>`
    }
}

document.body.innerHTML = rml`
  <main>
    ${conditionalStream}
  </main>
```

## The little gotcha!
Never forget to tag your templates with `rml`, otherwise they won't be reactive.
This is a standard piece of HTML string: 
```ts
const str = `<div>hello</div>`
```

And this is a reactive template managed by Rimmel:
```ts
const str = rml`<div>hello</div>`
```


## Forward Refs? An unnecessary evil
Forward refs are a construct used in Imperative-Reactive UI libraries to enable referencing and later modifying DOM elements that don't exist yet (you're writing components that to act on DOM elements that will only exist after they are mounted).

The simple, yet effective functional paradigm used by Rimmel enables you to define any change to a DOM element as a Promise or Observable stream. The mounting and data binding is completely managed by Rimmel. This means when they resolve or emit, the elements will already be there to receive them, effectively making the use of Forward Refs redundant.


## Structured Data? We stop here and this is why
When you're dealing with structured data, like lists or grids of repeated data, the best way to handle it depends on multiple factors, so it's left as an extension opportunity.

You can create your custom, advanced Sinks to render data structures of any complexity and manage any specific aspects of its interactions in the most optimal way for your needs.
This is a perfect case for reactive grids, spreadsheets, SVG or Canvas drawings, interactive 3D scenes, etc.

To display and manage the UI for any dynamic list where you plan to support CRUD operations, perhaps drag'n'drop, you may consider using a `Collection` from [ObservableTypes](https://github.com/reactivehtml/observable-types), which is a rendering-aware extension of `Array`, every method of which is mapped to an optimised UI rendering command, and it also exposes the `Observable` and `Observer` interfaces for seamless reactivity and integration with Rimmel and RxJS.


<br>


## ðŸ‘‹ Hello WorldðŸ‘‹ ++
Want a more involved example?<br>
Let's make a component featuring a Red, Green and Blue slider that get transformed into an #RRGGBB colour string, displayed in a text box and used as the fill colour of an SVG circle:

<img src="docs/assets/how-rimmel-works-5.png" alt="Rimmel Sources and Sinks" style="max-height: 100vh;">

Here is the corresponding code:

```javascript
const toHex = n => n.toString(16).padStart(2, '0');
const toRGBString = rgbArr => `#${rgbArr.map(toHex).join('')}`;
const toNumericStream = x => new Subject().pipe(
  map(e => parseInt(e.target.value, 10)),
  startWith(x),
);

const ColorPicker = (initial = [0, 0, 0]) => {
  const [R, G, B] = initial.map(toNumericStream);
  const RGB = combineLatest([R, G, B]).pipe(
    map(toRGBString),
  );

  return rml`
    R: <input type="range" value="${initial[0]}" oninput="${R}">
       <span>${R}</span>

    G: <input type="range" value="${initial[1]}" oninput="${G}">
       <span>${G}</span>

    B: <input type="range" value="${initial[2]}" oninput="${B}">
       <span>${B}</span>

    Current <span>${RGB}</span>

    <svg viewbox="0 0 40 40" width="40" height="40">
      <circle fill="${RGB}" cx="20" cy="20" r="20" />
    </svg>
  `;
}

document.getElementById('root-node').innerHTML = ColorPicker([255, 128, 64])
```

<br><br>

<div class="playground-link">
<a href="https://codepen.io/fourtyeighthours/pen/ExJOObG"><img src="docs/assets/try-it-button.png" valign="middle" height="40"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://codepen.io/fourtyeighthours/pen/ExJOObG">Hello World Plus</a> on Codepen
</div>
<br>

As you can see, there are three main streams, one for each colour slider in the HTML.
When they emit, their values are merged together through `combineLatest`, which passes them through as an array to `toRGBString` which will return the string as we need it.

Finally, we have two sinks where the data ends up; one as the innerHTML of the <span>, ther other as the fill colour of the SVG shape.

<br>

## State doesn't exist (it's a Stream)
"State", as the word itself suggests, is something static, so it doesn't belong to the dynamic, interactive, reactive webapps we make every day.

The rationale is that "state", as represented by plain old values such as numbers, strings and objects that are stored somewhere in memory is something you almost never need to read. Not now, not in 2 seconds, not in 45 minutes, not tomorrow. You only need those when certain events happen, in order to respond.

After that, everything should go quiet, including your CPU, to keep your laptop cool until the next UI event occurs.

This is, in summary, the _discrete-functional-reactive_ paradigm behind Observables and RxJS (as opposed to the functional-reactive paradigm in general in which state is more like a continuous flow of data).

Event-driven reactivity as modelled by Observables is therefore the perfect way to describe state as it changes through the lifetime of an application at the occurrence of various discrete UI events.


<img src="docs/assets/how-rimmel-works-9.png" alt="State doesn't exist" style="max-height: 100vh;">


Modelling your state as one or more observable streams will give you fine-grained control over async events and their coordination, thanks to the full range of RxJS operators you can use.

All Rimmel does is binding your observable streams to the UI in a seamless integration that will result in improved code quality, scale, testability and performance.

## Global State? It's just another Stream
Rimmel doesn't need any "global state manager" other than plain-old RxJS.<br>
Just create your own /lib/something, expose relevant Observables or Observers and use them from anywhere.


## "Lifecycle Events" are dead (you have streams)
Component lifecycle events such as `onmount`, `beforeunmount`, present in most other impera// Style
const stream = new Subject<CSSStyleObject>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div style="${stream}"></div>`;

tive frameworks quickly become useless, redudant and discouraged here.
Streams and other listeners get connected and disconnected automatically for you when a component is mounted/unmounted. If you think about it, this is exactly what you would normally do in your init/onmount functions, so you no longer have to deal with these tiny details.

Since you only declare streams now and let Rimmel connect them to the DOM and each-other, your code will be immensely more concise, cleaner and more testable.

Rimmel still has a `rml:onmount` event, but its use is only left as a last resort to integrate imperative, non-Rimmel components (some old jQuery plugins, etc?)

## Side Effects are put aside (that's what a framework is for)
You may have already realised that writing UI components with Rimmel means you no longer have to deal with side effects, which makes it trivial to make your code purely functional.

# Sources vs. Sinks
There are two key concepts used by Rimmel: sources and sinks.

Sources are things that generate data which you can optionally process and transform along the way. What remains goes somewhere. That _somewhere_ is usually referred to as a sink.

Sources typically include any DOM events such as `onclick` or `onmousemove`, `fetch()` calls, just like promises in general, async functions and, most notably, Observables.

Sinks are most often the place where you want to display any information in the UI. Your main document, some HTML element, etc.

With RML/Rimmel you can treat most DOM elements as sources, sinks, or both.

## Event Sources
Rimmel supports event listeners from all DOM elements.
Static values are treated as non-observable values and no data-binding will be created.
Observers such as Subjects and BehaviorSubjects will receive events as emitted by the DOM.

### Examples:

```ts
// Observable Subjects
const stream = new Subject<MouseEvent>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<button onclick="${stream}></button>`;


// Plain functions
const fn = (e: MouseEvent) => alert('hover');
target.innerHTML = rml`<a onmouseover="${fn}></button>`;

// Event Delegation
const buttonClicks = new Subject<MouseEvent>().pipe(
  filter(e => e.target.tagName == 'BUTTON')
);

target.innerHTML = rml`
   <div onclick="${buttonClicks}>
     <button>button1</button>
     <button>button2</button>
     <button>button3</button>
   </div>
`;
```

<br>

### Event Adapters
In normal circumstances your event handlers receive a native DOM `Event` object, such as `MouseEvent`, `PointerEvent`, etc.

To enable a better separation of concerns, as of Rimmel 1.2 you can use Event Mappers, or Event Adapters to feed your event handlers or Observable streams the exact data they need, in the format they expect it, rather than the generic, raw DOM Event objects.

Do you only need the relative `[x, y]` mouse coordinates when hovering an element?<br>
Use `<div onmousemove="${ OffsetXY(handler) }">`

Do you want the last typed character when handling keyboard events?
Use `<input oninput="${ Key(handler) }">`

Rimmel comes with a handful of Event Adapters out of the box, but you can create your own with ease.

If you know how to use the <a href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/pipe">`pipe()`</a> function from RxJS, then you almost know how to use `source(...operators, target)` from Rimmel.
It works like `pipe()`, except it applies the same operators to data coming in, rather than going out of an Observable stream.

`source(...operators, targetObserver)`

```js
import { rml, source } from 'rimmel';

const DatasetValue = map((e: Event) => Number(e.target.dataset.value));
const ButtonClick = filter((e: Event) => e.target.tagName == 'BUTTON');

const Component = () => {
  const total = new Subject<number>().pipe(
    scan((a, b) => a+b, 0)
  );

  return rml`
    <div onclick="${source(ButtonClick, DatasetValue, total)}">

      <button data-value="1">add one</button>
      <button data-value="2">add two</button>
      <button data-value="3">add three</button>

    </div>

    Sum: <span>${total}</span>
  `;
};
```

As you can see, the main data model, which is the observable stream called `total`, receives `number` and emits `number`.
The `DatasetValue` Event Adapter translates raw DOM events into the plain numbers required by the model.
Finally, we're leveraging the DOM's standard Event Delegation by only adding one listener to the container, rather than to each button. We're making sure only button clicks are captured by using the `ButtonClick` filter

<br>

## Data Sinks
Rimmel supports two categories of sinks: standard (specialised) sinks and dynamic sinks.
Standard sinks are the simplest and most intuitive ones: those you define in an everyday template from which the type of data binding required can be easily inferred. They are optimised for performance, updating a specific part of the DOM.<br />

These include:
- Class (add/remove/change classes to an element)
- Dataset (add/remove/change dataset values)
- Value (set the value of an input field)
- Style (apply styles from a CSS Object/key-value pair)
- Closed (set the closed attribute of a dialog box)
- Removed (destroy an element when a source emits)
- Disabled (disable a UI control)
- Readonly (make a UI control read-only)
- InnerText, TextContent, InnerHTML, PrependHTML, AppendHTML, Sanitize
- Attribute (set any generic HTML attribute not listed above)
- Custom Sinks (create your own for specific, optimised rendering of complex data)

### Implicit vs Explicit sinks
Some sinks are implicit as the surrounding HTML and/or CSS context makes it clear what they should do.
E.g.:
```html
<!-- set class names -->
<div class="${stream}">
<!-- set inline style -->
<div style="${stream}">
<!-- set background colour -->
<div style="background-color: ${stream};">
```

Other sinks can be specified explicitly when it's not obvious from the context or when several options are available to display the same content:
```html
<!-- Remove dangerous scripts from the stream before rendering -->
<div>${Sanitize(stream)}</div>
```

```html
<!-- Sink the stream's content into `.innerText`, rahter than `.innerHTML` (which is the default) on an element -->
<div>${InnerText(stream)}</div>
```

```html
<!-- You take control and decide exactly how that stream should be rendered -->
<!-- Useful for complex data structures -->
<div>${YourCustomSink(stream)}</div>
```

### Examples (using sinks):

```ts
// InnerHTML (this is implicit, from the context)
const stream = new Subject<HTMLString>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div>${stream}</div>`;

// InnerText (the easy way to prevent XSS)
const stream = new Subject<HTMLString>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div>${InnerText(stream)}</div>`;

// Class
const stream = new Subject<CSSClassObject>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div class="${stream}"></div>`;

// Style
const stream = new Subject<CSSStyleObject>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div style="${stream}"></div>`;

// CSS
const stream = new Subject<string>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div style="color: ${stream};"></div>`;

// Data Attribute
const stream = new Subject<string>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div data-attribute="${stream}"></div>`;

// Disabled Attribute
const stream = new Subject<boolean>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<button disabled="${stream}">clickable</button>`;

// Removed (this is a RML attribute, not a standard HTML one)
const stream = new Subject<boolean>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div rml:removed="${stream}"></div>`;

// Closed
const stream = new Subject<boolean>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<dialog closed="${stream}">...</dialog>`;

// Generic Attribute
const stream = new Subject<string>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div some-attribute="${stream}"></div>`;

// "Sanitize" - display render-safe HTML
import { rml, Sanitize } from 'rimmel';

const stream = new Subject<HTMLString>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div>${Sanitize(stream)}</div>`;

// A "Custom" Sink to just make output uppercase
const UpperCase = sink(
  map(strHTML => strHTML.toUpperCase())
);

const stream = new Subject<HTMLString>();
target.innerHTML = rml`<div>${UpperCase(stream)}</div>`;
```

Dynamic sinks, on the other hand, are optimised for size and designed for convenience. They can take anyhing as input and figure out how to update the DOM at runtime.


## Extensible Components (Mixins)
Mixins are an exciting by-product of dynamic sinks, which allow you to inject pretty much anything at any time (event listeners, classes, attributes, etc) into the target "host" element by means of emitting a `DOM Object`Â­â€” a plain-old object whose properties and methods represent DOM attributes and event listeners.

<br>

```javascript
const Mixin = () => {
  const onmouseover = () => console.log('mouseover')

  const onclick = new Subject()

  // Emit 'clickable' first,
  // then 'clicked' afterwards
  const classes = onclick.pipe(
    mapTo('clicked-class'),
    startWith('clickable'),
  );

  // <! -----------------------------
  // The following DOM Object will be
  // "merged" into the target element
  // <! -----------------------------
  return {
    onclick,
    onmouseover,
    class: classes,
    'data-new-attribute': 'some value',
  }
}

// ----------------------------
// And this is how you call it:
// ----------------------------
const component = () => {
  return rml`
    <div ...${Mixin()}></div>
  `;
}
```

<br>

When the above component is rendered on the page, the mixin will inject everything else into it, including the `onclick` and the `onmouseover` event handlers, a statically defined `data-new-attribute` and a "merge-in" observable stream, `classes` to set classes dynamically.

Whenever the `classes` stream emits, you will be able to set/unset class names in the component.

#### No reference to the host element
You may have noticed that mixins doesn't get any reference to the elements you merge them into.

In the imperative paradigm you would indeed have one, so you can imperatively set `hostElement.classList.add('big')`.

In order to stick with good functional principles, mixins only return this `DOM Object`, which is a declarative way to tell Rimmel what you want it to set on the host element.

```js
  const returnValue = <DOMObject>{
    onclick,
    onmouseover,
    'class': classes,
    'data-new-attribute': 'some value',
    'rml:closed': closedStream,
    'disabled': disabledStream,
    'readonly': readonlyStream,
    'innerHTML': contentStream1,
    'appendHTML': contentStream2,
    // etc...
  }
```

<br>

### A simple drag'n'drop mixin
A simple use case for mixins is drag'n'drop, in the form of an isolated, reusable piece of functionality.

<img src="docs/assets/how-rimmel-works-7.png" alt="Rimmel Sources and Sinks" style="max-height: 100vh;">

The code above is a simple function that performs its business and returns a DOM object.
Whatever it contains is merged into the host element.
Static key-values (e.g.: `class`) are merged on the spot, before mounting.
Promises and Observables get merged whenever they resolve/emit.

# Performance

Performance is always key, isn't it?

Actually, it depends. Some studies, in fact, show that a little bit of waiting in _certain conditions_ can actually improve the overall user experience! _(Bryant&amp;Veroff, Kahneman&amp;Tversky, Brickman&amp;Campbell, Schultz)_


Anyway, Rimmel is fast. You can slow it down with the `Rx.delay()` operator if you want, but if you don't, it's fast and here's why:<br>

- It doesn't use a Virtual DOM. If you ever believed the story that the DOM is slow and re-running your components' code every time you blink an eye is the fast and good thing to do, you may have been the victim of a scam.<br>

- Rimmel updates the DOM using "precharged" Sinks, which are just some little element-bound functions that won't need to perform any lookup, but are just ready to update the DOM as fast as possible.<br>
As a result, your updates in certain cases may happen even faster than the normal `document.getElementById(target).style.color = newColor`.<br>

We call this the **Vanilla+ Speed**.

- Lightweight bundle size. V1 was just 2.5KB of code. Now it's a little more as we're sorting out a few things with specialised sinks and we are in a bit of a feature rush, but the aim is to fall back below 1KB with the launch of the new template compiler.

- The rest is on you. Rimmel is a minimalistic UI library, but the true reason for its immense power is RxJS being behind its reactivity.

<br>

### Special cases of "fast"
Do you have a Combobox with 1M rows?<br>
A large spreadsheet with 1k x 10k reactive cells?<br>
An HFT stock ticker with 10000 subscriptions?<br>

These are obviously cases where "fast updates" or raw speed are irrelevant and what truly matters is adequate frontend architecture.<br>

These are perfect cases to create Custom Sinks implementing relevant design patterns to make extreme scenarios still work optimally in an ergonomic, functional-reactive style that's easy to test and keep well organised.

<br>

## Memory management
If you come from some other libraries or frameworks, including "vanilla RxJS", you know you're somewhat responsible of cleaning up memory. The indiscriminate use of Observable subscriptions without proper cleanup can cause memory leaks in certain scenarios.

Using Observables with Rimmel is trivial. All DOM subscriptions and event listeners are handled by the library behind the scenes, registered when a component is mounted and unregistered when it's removed.

<br>

## "Suspense" for free, out of the box
Do you have async data like an API call and a placeholder to display whilst waiting? We have good news: a `BehaviorSubject` is all you need.

A `BehaviorSubject` receives a special treatment from Rimmel in that its initial value will be rendered immediately, synchronously, whilst subsequent emissions will replace it as normal. This helps avoid unnecessary reflows and jank on the page.

```javascript
import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';

const WaitingComponent = () => {
  const stream = new BehaviorSubject('loading...');

  ajax.getJSON('https://api.example.com/data')
    .pipe(map(data => `<pre>${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>`))
    .subscribe(stream)
  ;

  return rml`
    <div>${stream}</div>
  `;
}
```

## Migrating from/to other frameworks
It might sound unusual, but Rimmel can actually coexist with other frameworks.
Your Rimmel component can be embedded in a React component and have children made in Vue, or even jQuery plugins or sit inside a larger jQuery application, or any other way around.

If you are planning a progressive framework migration, you can do it one component at a time.

## Use with AI assistants/LLMs
We are creating a few experimental AI assistants like [RimmelGPT.js](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-L01pb60It-rimmelgpt-js), to help you convert existing components, create new ones or just get started and have fun. 

(Please note these are still highly experimental and various forms of hallucination can happen under different circumstances â€” YMMV)

## A Colour Picker component
In a component like a colour picker there's a lot of derived state to manage, from various inputs and controls, mouse and touch actions, copy-paste, drag'n'drop.
RxJS can handle these without blinking an eye whilst Rimmel just glues them together.

Remember, this is complex by nature and without RxJS it would be much worse!

- Performance benchmarks (we know it's fast, but, let's see the numbers!)
- SSR, Server Components, Full-Stack Components, Transferable Promises, Transferable Observables
- Scheduler support for real-time apps (trading front-ends, ad-tech, gaming, ...)
- Support text node and HTML comment sinks
- EventEmitter support?
- Separate memory-optimised and speed-optimised sinks
- Convenience vs Performance sinks
- Compiled Templates (because it's never fast and light enough, right?)
- JSX/ESX support?
- Plugin support
- Sink pipelines (just like you have rendering pipelines in computer graphics)
- RML Security (leverage sink pipelines to weed out XSS and other dirt)
- i18n (leverage sink pipelines to make localisation trivial)

# Building, testing and hacking
To work with Rimmel locally, check it out then either with bun or other runtimes:

```bash
npm install
npm run test
npm run build
```

There is a "kitchen sink" app you can use to play around locally, which should showcase most of what you can do with Rimmel:
```bash
cd examples/kitchen-sink
vite
```

# Web Standards
There are discussions going on around making HTML and/or the DOM natively support Observables at [WHATWG DOM/544](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/544) and especially the more recent [Observable DOM](https://github.com/WICG/observable).

Rimmel is closely following these initiatives and aims to align with them as they develop.

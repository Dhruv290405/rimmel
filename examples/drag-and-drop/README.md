# Drag-and-drop example

This folder demonstrates a simple drag-and-drop mixin using Rimmel attribute mixins and pointer events.

Contents
- `index.ts` — (recommended) example harness mounting the draggable mixin to some elements.

What to look for
- Using `...${Mixin()}` to merge events and attributes into a host element.
- Scoping Subjects per-instance to avoid leaks.

Run locally
1. cd to repo root
2. npm install
3. build or run kitchen-sink demo which includes this example

Add a small runnable example here (TS/HTML) if you'd like — I can scaffold `index.ts` and demo HTML next.

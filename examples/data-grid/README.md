# Data-grid example (skeleton)

This folder will contain a sample data grid demonstrating:
- Custom sink for virtualised rows
- Per-cell streams for editing
- Bulk operations and selection

Purpose
- Provide a real-world example showing how Rimmel's sinks and ObservableTypes can be used for complex UIs where per-cell reactivity matters.

Next steps
- I can add a minimal `index.ts` with a virtualised list and row-level Subjects to demonstrate the pattern. Tell me if you want the complete runnable demo scaffolded.
